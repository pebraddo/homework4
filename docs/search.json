Each project also serves as a working directory, so sharing and collaborating with others is easier.\n\nWhat is git and what is github?\n\nGit is a version control software and Github is a tool where Git is hosted.\n\nWhat are the two main differences between a tibble and a data.frame?\n\nTibbles print in a more efficient and interpret-able way than data frames. They show the first couple of rows and columns and a count of the number of total observations and columns. Tibbles are also more strict and require consistent data types than data frames.\n\nRewrite the following nested function call using BaseRâ€™s chaining operator:\narrange(filter(select(as_tibble(iris), starts_with(\"Petal\"), Species), Petal.Length &lt;1.55), Species)\n\niris |&gt;\nas_tibble() |&gt;\nselect(starts_with(\"Petal\"), Species) |&gt;\nfilter(Petal.Length &lt;1.55) |&gt;\narrange(Species)",
